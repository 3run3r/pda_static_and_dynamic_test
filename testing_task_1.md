class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1 #there is no 'value' property defined in the constructor
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2) #should be def, the function won't be able to be defined.
  if card1.value > card2.value #see first comment.
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end # this is an extra 'end',

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total #variable is not defined/assigned to anything so it cannot be used.
  for card in cards
    total += card.value #see comment above
    return "You have a total of" + total #see comment above
  end
end

#there is not an 'end' to the 'class' statement.
